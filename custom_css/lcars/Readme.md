# The LCARS skin for HADashboard

using this skin is really easy if you have appdaemon/hadashboard installed.
all you need is a directory named custom_css in your conf(iguration) directory
there you create the lcars directory with the files in it and you are good to go.

the skin has a background that can be used with different resolutions.
i created example dashboards for 3 different resolutions, but you also can change the settings yourself.

here are the settings you need to change for different resolutions

## 800 x 480
in variables.yaml set screenwidth to 800
